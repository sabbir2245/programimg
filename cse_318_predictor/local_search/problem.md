# CSE 318 Assignment 02 — Solving the Max-Cut Problem by GRASP

## The Maximum Cut (MAX-CUT) Problem

Given an undirected graph G = (V, U), where V is the set of vertices and U is the set of edges, and weights w_uv associated with each edge (u, v) ∈ U. The Maximum Cut (MAX-CUT) problem consists in finding a nonempty proper subset of vertices S ⊂ V (S ≠ ∅), such that the weight of the cut (S, S̄), given by

```
w(S, S̄) = Σ_{u∈S, v∈S̄} w_uv
```

is maximized.

The above figure shows four cuts having different weights on a graph with five nodes and seven edges. The maximum cut has S = {1, 2, 4} and S̄ = {3, 5}, with weight w(S, S̄) = 50.

## Solving a Combinatorial Optimization Problem by GRASP

GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) is a randomized multistart iterative method for computing good quality solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Each GRASP iteration is usually made up of:

- a **construction phase**, where a feasible solution is constructed, and
- a **local search phase**, which starts at the constructed solution and applies iterative improvement until a locally optimal solution is found.

Typically, the construction phase of GRASP is a semi-greedy or randomized greedy algorithm.

### Algorithm 1: GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure)

```
1: procedure GRASP(MaxIterations)
2:    for i = 1 to MaxIterations do
3:       Build a greedy randomized solution x using semi-greedy heuristic
4:       x ← LocalSearch(x)
5:       if i = 1 then
6:           x* ← x
7:       else if w(x) > w(x*) then
8:           x* ← x
9:       end if
10:   end for
11:   return x*
12: end procedure
```

## Randomized Heuristic for the Maximum Cut Problem

The algorithm starts with both partitions X and Y being empty. For each vertex v ∈ V, it is placed in either partition X or Y uniformly at random, with probability 1/2 each. The final cut is determined by the edges crossing between the two partitions. To get a reliable estimate of the cut size, the algorithm is run n times and the results are averaged.

### Algorithm 2: Randomized Heuristic for MAX-CUT

```
1: procedure RandomizedMaxCut(G = (V, E), w, n)
2:    totalCutWeight ← 0
3:    for i = 1 to n do
4:       Initialize partitions: X ← ∅, Y ← ∅
5:       for all vertex v ∈ V do
6:           if Random choice with probability >= 1/2 then
7:               X ← X ∪ {v}
8:           else
9:               Y ← Y ∪ {v}
10:          end if
11:      end for
12:      cutWeight ← Σ_{(u,v)∈E, u∈X,v∈Y or u∈Y,v∈X} w_uv
13:      totalCutWeight ← totalCutWeight + cutWeight
14:   end for
15:   averageCutWeight ← totalCutWeight / n
16:   return averageCutWeight
17: end procedure
```

## Greedy Heuristic for the Maximum Cut Problem

The algorithm starts by placing one vertex to each partition X and Y (initially both are empty) such that each contains an endpoint of the edge with the largest weight. The remaining |V| − 2 vertices are then considered one by one. For each unassigned vertex, it is placed into the partition (X or Y) where it contributes the most to the current partial cut. This placement is done greedily at each iteration.

### Algorithm 3: Greedy Heuristic for MAX-CUT

```
1: procedure GreedyMaxCut(G = (V, E), w)
2:    Initialize partitions: X ← ∅, Y ← ∅
3:    Find edge (u, v) ∈ E with maximum weight w_uv
4:    X ← X ∪ {u}, Y ← Y ∪ {v}
5:    U ← V \ {u, v}                                          ▷ Unassigned vertices
6:    for all vertex z ∈ U do
7:        Compute weight if z ∈ X: w_X = Σ_{y∈Y} w_zy
8:        Compute weight if z ∈ Y: w_Y = Σ_{x∈X} w_zx
9:        if w_X > w_Y then
10:           X ← X ∪ {z}
11:       else
12:           Y ← Y ∪ {z}
13:       end if
14:   end for
15:   return partitions X, Y
16: end procedure
```

## Semi-Greedy Heuristic for the Maximum Cut Problem

A semi-greedy heuristic builds on a greedy function by introducing randomness in the candidate selection process. For each candidate element v, a greedy function is evaluated. Based on these values, candidates are ranked and a Restricted Candidate List (RCL) is constructed. One element is then randomly selected from the RCL to extend the current partial solution.

There are two primary strategies for building the RCL:

- **Cardinality-based method**: Selects the top-k candidates (e.g., k = 5 or k = 10).
- **Value-based method**: Selects all candidates v with greedy function value ≥ μ, where

```
μ = w_min + α · (w_max − w_min)
```

and α ∈ [0, 1] is a tunable parameter.

For the above greedy heuristic, the candidate elements are vertices which are not yet assigned to set X and set Y. Let V′ = V − {X ∪ Y} be the set of all candidate elements. The cut-off value is denoted by

```
μ = w_min + α · (w_max − w_min)          (1)
```

where α is a parameter such that 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, and the restricted candidate list consists of all vertices whose value of the greedy function is greater than or equal to μ. A vertex is randomly selected from the restricted candidate list.

For each vertex v, we define

```
σ_X(v) = Σ_{u∈X} w_vu      and      σ_Y(v) = Σ_{u∈Y} w_vu
```

The greedy function value of v is

```
max{σ_X(v), σ_Y(v)}
```

However, w_min and w_max can be updated using the following naive rules:

```
w_min = min{ min_{v∈V′} σ_X(v), min_{v∈V′} σ_Y(v) }
w_max = max{ max_{v∈V′} σ_X(v), max_{v∈V′} σ_Y(v) }
```

Use equation (1) for determining the placement of the current candidate vertex in X or Y.

## Local Search for the Maximum Cut Problem

Assume that we have obtained a feasible solution at the end of the construction phase and S, S̄ are two partitions of the current solution (S, S̄). The local search phase is based on the following neighborhood structure. To each vertex v ∈ V, we associate either the neighbor (S − {v}, S̄ ∪ {v}) if v ∈ S, or the neighbor (S ∪ {v}, S̄ − {v}) if v ∈ S̄.

The value

```
δ(v) = { σ_S(v) − σ_S̄(v), if v ∈ S
       { σ_S̄(v) − σ_S(v), if v ∈ S̄            (2)
```

represents the change in the objective function (MAX-CUT value) associated with moving vertex v from one subset of the cut to the other. All possible moves are investigated and the best improving neighbor replaces the current solution.

The local search stops when no improving neighbor is found after evaluation of all possible moves (we are stuck in a local optima).

## Input Format

The input is provided as a text file with the following structure:

- The first line contains two integers: **n** and **m**, where:
  - **n** is the number of vertices
  - **m** is the number of edges (the size of the graph).
- Each of the next **m** lines describes an edge of the graph using three integers:

```
V1  V2  Wt
```

  - **V1** and **V2** are the endpoints of the edge,
  - **Wt** is the weight associated with the edge (V1, V2).

The graphs are **undirected**.

You need to implement the algorithms: **Greedy**, **Randomized**, **Semi-Greedy**, **Local Search** and **GRASP**. For each of these algorithms, you are required to record the performance on **all 54 benchmark graphs**. For the Semi-Greedy algorithm, you need to use the **value-based selection method** as described earlier.

### 2. CSV File Submission

A CSV file named **2205***.csv should be submitted summarizing the results obtained from running the different algorithms on the 54 benchmark graphs provided.

For semi-greedy, you may include information regarding value of α.

You should be prepared to regenerate the result for any one algorithm on any one graph during evaluation.

### 3. Report Submission

Along with the CSV file, you should submit a brief report in PDF format (renamed as **2205***.pdf). The report should include:

- A high-level description of each algorithm implemented (Randomized, Greedy, Semi-Greedy, Local Search, GRASP).
- Comparison of algorithms (e.g., which algorithm consistently performs better across the benchmarks).
- Plots or visualizations that demonstrate how the algorithms perform across different graphs.

An example plot is shown in the PDF for reference. You do not need to match the exact values as shown in the sample plots—they are included for illustration only.
